# To Do List
  
##### A small small project  
##### Reads the file name "to do list.txt", then the program will sort it by date.  
##### The format of the .txt file are as follows:  
  
"things to do" "(due date)"  
  
###### Assume the date of today is 12/11  
  
Ex:  
write some code (1215)  
play with friends (1216)  
go shopping (1211)  

Excepted output:  
1211 go shopping (Due today!!!)  
1215 write some code  
1216 play with friends  
  
Analysis:  
time complexity: O(nlogn)  
space complexity: O(n)  
While n represents the size of the to dos.
